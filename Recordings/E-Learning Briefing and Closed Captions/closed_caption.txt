10:05:08 Yeah, go up. Yes, it's by. Go out.
10:05:13 Okay, let's move to the skills training.
10:05:19 Okay, these are skills learning.
10:05:23 You're gonna see my slides.
10:05:26 Yup can see.
10:05:27 Yes.
10:05:26 Okay, very good. Okay. Let me move on.
10:05:33 Okay. So I think yesterday we talked about, why is it important to have this?
10:05:42 Does use learning. So we are slowly moving towards. Skews, based economy, meaning they say, that you are being hired, not by how many degree master degree or diploma you have, but by with what are the skews that you actually have okay, so through this digital skews learning
10:06:09 you can actually update industry, recognized certification. And then you can actually show this as part of your credentials to your participants in the future.
10:06:19 And also you actually get a chance upgrade your skills and increase your chance of employment.
10:06:26 Okay. Lastly, we also want to train you, acquire a Jo learning abilities meaning, you'll see that whenever you meet.
10:06:36 So then skews. It is critical for you to keep going back to.
10:06:40 Why are the skills okay? And then go to work? Because, you know, right, I talk about digital transformation.
10:06:50 Yesterday. Things are moving. So far it is impossible for you to keep going back to school every now and then go for diploma, or go for a degree program right?
10:07:02 Just to acquire certificates or acquire a skills as you need to have the ability to acquire a learning abilities either through this kind of digital skill certifications, or through other kind of micro potential.
10:07:20 Okay. So I'll show you in this on day, one on Tab, skew, stream work and on top is actually the technical skills digital marketing data, analytics, sustainability.
10:07:36 Ui, U. S. Design and financial, and I have also show you that why we chose this because these are the jobs they'll be in demand, or still they will be in demand.
10:07:47 Okay in the future. Alright. So that's why we chose this alright as one of the key skills to have.
10:07:59 Okay, some of you may already have some of this, but we just want to enhance them.
10:08:04 Okay, so our D learning will be actually based on this.
10:08:11 Oh, this just gives learning is for you is a personal learning journey, you know.
10:08:20 So you're supposed to acquire them on a personal basis.
10:08:23 But you can actually consider, you know, asking your a hot means whether they want to come together and then take the same cause, and then you can help check on each other progress or exchange notes, you know, is we leave it entirely up to you and your call hall, means, to coordinate this last year.
10:08:45 They shared resources with each other. Okay, those in the same costs.
10:08:50 They share resources with each other. I help each other go through, and then the Agg go back to school or Rp.
10:09:02 So last year was a Tp. So they go back to school, and then they study together the form study group.
10:09:09 But we leave it entirely up to you is for you to call in it yourself, and or if lesson, you prefer to study alone.
10:09:18 That's perfect in tap. You need to complete at least 2 out of the 5 learning tracks in order to fulfill one of the criteria for completion of the course and to get your stipend.
10:09:34 Okay, and we meant it. Last year the participants who didn't complete it.
10:09:39 We will, with full styled, until they complete the E-learning.
10:09:45 Alright. But can I talk to you about the learning names?
10:09:49 Later. But I'll share it. Okay.
10:09:59 Every Friday you will is actually dedicated for you to do your digital E-learning.
10:10:09 Okay, is up, to old free time. Let you arrange it.
10:10:14 If you want to study at night after the program or during the weekend, it is entirely up to you.
10:10:22 Where is it? It's a virtual learning, so you don't need to come to Rp by if you find that Rp.
10:10:29 Has more conducive environment, you are more likely to join us.
10:10:33 There will not be any facilitator around during your evening.
10:10:40 Okay, the is that instructions of the costs will only be given to you once you have selected the cost.
10:10:52 Okay, we will send to you for you to fill up the survey next week.
10:11:00 Okay, so today. And this weekend is for you to reach through the different options order to consider.
10:11:07 And next week, when you getather in your final teams, you can actually discuss amongst your team who will learn what skills in order to complete the project.
10:11:18 Okay, so it's entirely to you. Believe it because you are supposed to learn how to learn in independently.
10:11:28 Okay, the learning tracks, the 5 of them, number one.
10:11:35 This is financial market. Okay?
10:11:45 So what are financial markets? Any marketplace where the trading of securities I.
10:11:51 E, your shares, you know your bonds, and things like that occur so it can be a stock market there's a need to understand this financial market.
10:12:01 Alright, and also Singapore is growing. Our financial sector.
10:12:10 We AIM to be the Asia financial hub right?
10:12:14 So if you want to go into the finance sector, okay, you can consider this call.
10:12:20 Called Bloom Book, market Concept.
10:12:24 Okay, Bloomberg market concept. If you are interested to go into the finance sector.
10:12:31 Okay. Lumber is a globally aggregated institutions in providing financial news, software tools.
10:12:39 Major companies and organization, basically, anybody in the financial sector who wants to know about the latest happening, or they need to plan some strategy will definitely have to use Bloomberg's product.
10:12:58 Why is Bloomberg market concept so recognized? Because the so-called, like a authority in the finance sector?
10:13:09 Okay, so you can consider thinking this pause. If you are interested in.
10:13:15 There are 4. Call modules, number one, economy, indicator.
10:13:20 Understand. One is currencies, fixed income and equity. Of course there are optional modules for you to take to deepen your practical knowledge in finance sector, but the full home modulus.
10:13:36 Once you complete them you'll be given the certificates.
10:13:39 The optional modules is really entirely up to you to see if you want to think, I will highly recommend that you also complete the optional modules.
10:13:50 Okay, the links is here. You can actually click the link later to read more.
10:13:57 And next normal. And anyway, this slide I will also post on Ms teams so that you can meet this later at your own free time.
10:14:05 Okay. So I think I mentioned that there's no need for you to do the extra modules, the optional modules to opt in the certificate.
10:14:15 Bye, you are highly encouraged to also look into the extra module.
10:14:23 Okay, you can complete the 4 call module first to get a certification, and then after that bang and work on the optional module.
10:14:37 The program. Just need you to produce the certification of completion.
10:14:43 Okay. That is for Bloomberg market concept. This is how it looks like, and the certification for your info Mike has completed this cost as simple as it sounds, or it looks actually, you need to spend some time looking at it.
10:15:02 Yeah, there are no exam at the end of the course, but you just need to take some fees in between each module.
10:15:10 Okay. So if you listen to the course or read properly, you should be able to answer the okay.
10:15:18 He's not meant to be like super hard, and then they give you a grid or or a bell curve like that kind of stuff.
10:15:28 Okay, you. It's only a pass of.
10:15:31 Okay. And once you get the cost, you can actually upload a link in and then show off to the whole world that you actually complete this cost.
10:15:41 Okay, I will move on. The next one is on sustainability.
10:15:48 Okay, sustainability. It's very, very wide.
10:15:53 It's a very broad term, but what all is the company in the world needs to do is every quarter they need to do.
10:16:02 This thing called yes, to reporting environmental, social, and governance, reporting don't worry about it.
10:16:08 We actually have a lecture on sustainability where you actually know more.
10:16:16 But this is for people who are considering going to. You know the finance sector and the esc reporting, because there is where the most jobs are actually at alright.
10:16:29 So Bloomberg also offers this course on Esg.
10:16:34 It's a new course, right? And why is it so good?
10:16:39 Because, you know, there's actually a lot of push by the Singapore Government for Singapore to be.
10:16:49 And so it is helpful for you. If you want to go into that.
10:16:54 Okay, same thing. I is with Bloomberg. This course will help you implement Esg strategy and also help repair Esgb, it's all about preparing the reports to regulate this and also publishing it on your website so that investors.
10:17:16 Or your customers can read them and decide whether they want to put money to your organization.
10:17:22 It is very, very important. You will actually have a lecture by one of the breaker.
10:17:28 We will share with you more life as working in the Esg department.
10:17:33 In a list of companies. Okay, so this is how the cost will look right, for the Esg cost.
10:17:41 Okay, it is also given. You will also be provided to you for free. If you are interested.
10:17:48 Is on data, analytics. Okay? I think yesterday in my lecture, I mentioned that data is the new goal, right?
10:18:00 Data is what is the call? There will fewer the digital transformation.
10:18:08 Alright! So this is very, very important. And data analytics helps us to find out what are the tracks.
10:18:17 Make conclusion, make prediction, or drive informed decision making.
10:18:21 Okay, so many business today, you know, analyze their customer.
10:18:27 Data based on their satisfaction efficiency.
10:18:33 Okay, so data analytics is very helpful and can be applied to many, many different fields.
10:18:41 Many fews, many companies, many different roles require data, analytics.
10:18:47 It is so important. The Mo has to decide domain data, analytics, a compulsory learning module.
10:18:54 Or secondary school. Evo. Okay? And then all causes in polytechnic is slowly introducing data analytics as a fundamental models. A compulsory module also.
10:19:08 Okay, so for these costs that we recommend there are many different costs out there for or these costs that we recommend.
10:19:18 It is a foundation by Google on Coursera. Okay?
10:19:23 When you actually be introduced to skews, such as data visualizations, and excuse necessary for entry level data, analyze jobs.
10:19:34 Okay, this course is actually part of the. They are actually 8 modes in the whole certification program in or under Google.
10:19:46 But you only need to complete the first module, and if let's see, you has already finished this module and your Costsera certification is still valid.
10:19:59 Yeah. Fee to take on other modules.
10:20:03 Why is this cost highly recommended? Because Google also use this certificate.
10:20:11 As a credential to hire people they are okay. If you don't have a degree.
10:20:17 But with this you will actually consider you over a person with a degree.
10:20:23 Okay, so this is why it is highly recommended. So this is the course on the coursera.
10:20:31 Okay, there are many modules. You just need to complete the first module.
10:20:38 Okay, did you marketing, digital marketing, you know.
10:20:48 Right. I'll put how we actually buy stuff. A lot of them is okay.
10:20:56 So then, in order for brands to promote their product, they will have to then go into this realm called digital marketing, because you also highly go all right.
10:21:10 You will stay in your house, and then the Internet.
10:21:15 Look at. You know your handphone alright, and then, you know, for government decisions, a lot of them is active.
10:21:23 By what you read, what you see on so digital marketing will now allow the brains to connect with their potential customer through the so, by taking advantage of this, no, you can check more potential customer.
10:21:41 On engaging existing customer and provide a great customer experience.
10:21:50 Okay, so Google is one of the key platform for digital marketing with their search engine.
10:21:59 So Youtube search engine and even Google Maps, these are part of how Google is helping people with helping brands to promote their product.
10:22:16 Okay.
10:22:19 So we recommend this fundamental digital marketing, which is taught by Google Screener themselves.
10:22:27 And they will actually use practical activity. A real example. Okay, this is my, the open university, Google digital Garage.
10:22:37 Okay, you can actually check on this course to learn more about digital marketing.
10:22:46 Our graduate who who join Google for their is also Us.
10:22:55 To complete this course before the join Google. Okay, even the join , Google, Google, point them and ask them to complete this certification before they continue with that training.
10:23:12 Okay, so this is very helpful for people who wants to go into digital marketing.
10:23:27 Number 5 ui ux design. I know there's a lot of designer in the program, but Us.
10:23:38 Ui design is quite different from the kind of design that you may learn.
10:23:45 It is focusing on interaction between users and products or services, and making their interactions useful and enjoyable and accessible.
10:23:56 Okay. And then you ask me what Ui is user interface is actually a subset of user experience.
10:24:06 You have learned the design, thinking this way. So design thinking is just one skewset that you need to learn for ui ux.
10:24:21 Okay. Ui, ux is important because there are a lot of mobile device and then there's a lot of apps for you to use.
10:24:31 So it is critical for companies to provide good user experience to attract customers and keep them longer within your app.
10:24:40 So the longer this day, the longer that they will have the chance to purchase or buy anything from you.
10:24:49 Alright! So we offer 2 certificates.
10:24:58 Under this you can choose either one of them. Number one is foundation of user experience, designed by Google.
10:25:08 The second one is introduction to web accessibility, W. Threec.
10:25:18 Is actually the word authority on web content, accessible, guideline, in short, wcag web, content, accessible.
10:25:27 So basically, in some countries there are laws that states that all websites or apps must at least achieve a Wcag standard.
10:25:42 So by knowing this, okay, you can actually contribute to creating a more accessible web content or digital content.
10:25:56 And in fact, companies, if you are interested to go into design us ui design.
10:26:03 This will give you an h over many other, because not many people know how to do this.
10:26:12 Okay, so there are 2 move on to the different ones.
10:26:17 So the ones by Google, it is highly interactive. And then it's actually developed by Google's employee and train by them over the you will learn some in-demand designs, tools such as figma or adobext during the program, actually simulates
10:26:41 real-all Us design scenarios which is critical for success in the workplace.
10:26:46 For these calls same thing with the rest of the Google Coursera costs you just need to complete the first module, and if you have time, okay, you can actually take other modules but your priority is to complete learning, tracks.
10:27:02 And after that you are free to do whatever you want with it.
10:27:06 Okay, this is the Google costs. This is what you will learn.
10:27:11 You can actually click on the link and then explore them later.
10:27:18 This one is the W. Tracy I already mentioned. It's helpful for developers.
10:27:23 Designers or people with disability. Okay, where you can actually help contribute to a better web content. Then there's more accessible.
10:27:35 Okay, so you get to learn the international standards on web accessibility.
10:27:44 And you can actually help people with this ability use different assistive technology.
10:27:54 This is the cost. Okay, it is free for you to learn.
10:27:59 But if you want the certification, you actually need to pay.
10:28:02 But don't worry the progress. We'll cover the fees for you if you are interested to get the certification.
10:28:13 So final instructions. The information sheet for each course is available on Ms teams.
10:28:22 We have already posted. Okay, you are supposed to complete your tool.
10:28:27 Learning tracks, ie. Obtain 2 certifications by 26. Me, it's a Friday.
10:28:35 That's the latest.
10:28:39 And then you only have to start your e-learning next Friday.
10:28:45 You don't need to start now. You can start next Friday because you won't have the promo code to start the cost.
10:28:56 We need to give it to you right? So you need to choose first, we will give you the survey only next Wednesday.
10:29:05 I know. I mentioned Monday yesterday, but we have changed to mix.
10:29:11 Wednesday, because we want you to discuss with our team.
10:29:14 Hey, and then you all can divide and conquer.
10:29:17 See who takes one course to acquire the skews necessary, complete the project.
10:29:25 Okay.
10:29:29 So next Wednesday you'll be given the link on online phone for you to submit your choice of the tool learning tracks of the phone.
10:29:37 And discuss with. So you can actually discuss your choice with your project team.
10:29:43 Okay. Before making the final decision.
10:29:48 Which is the best cost to take. If you may ask some of your will, ask me some of this questions.
10:29:55 I thought I should really give you a FAQ.
10:29:58 The best cost for you is the one that you are actually most interested in.
10:30:04 There's no really best call, and of course the skews there's most relevant to all teams project.
10:30:13 Okay. So we'll give you until next week to discuss before before we ask you for a final choice.
10:30:21 Can I do more than 2 learning tracks? Okay, you are welcome to do so.
10:30:27 If you have completed the tool. Okay, the priority is for you to get the 2 certifications, and once you get them we are more than happy to give you the promo code for other skew certificates.
10:30:42 Okay, there are more than enough skill certificates to go around for all of you.
10:30:48 But we want you to prioritize getting your first 2 first.
10:30:53 Some people may ask why? 2. The reason is, because excuse nowadays are multi-disciplinary people.
10:31:04 You know, when employees look at you, or when they give you a task they usually spend across more than one discipline.
10:31:11 And hence we want you to acquire tool, so that at least you have, you know, some some sort of multi disciplinary skewset.
10:31:24 Do I need to pay for the skill, the cost there are a few causes that needs you to pay.
10:31:30 For example, the costsera one, and also the edx causes, but we will reimburse you after you complete the cost.
10:31:39 Okay. The reinvestment is only for the cost.
10:31:45 Then we have recommend in the program. So anything, all of it.
10:31:49 The reimbursement is not included, and also okay, there's a limit of $120 for the total cost fee that you need.
10:32:03 So, for example, if you are thinking the coursera once, we'll give you up to 2 months of subscription, so we'll pay for 2 months of your subscription whereby you need to complete them.
10:32:16 Within 2 months. Anything more than that you have to pay on your own.
10:32:24 2 months is about 10 weeks, where you actually have enough time to compete because it's only one module.
10:32:33 But if you want to take anything additional that is for you to consider, and people and.
10:32:42 Somebody may ask. You know, I at least, that some cause that I chose on the ongoing form.
10:32:50 Okay, you don't need to care about the selection that you meet previously.
10:32:56 There is only to help us get the enough number of promo code.
10:33:04 Okay, but you don't need to care about them. We will give you a fresh.
10:33:11 So we for you to fewer a fresh selection.
10:33:16 Fresh choice. So you do need to care about those that you have fewer previously on the option.
10:33:24 Okay. Now, I will open for questions and answers. If you have any.
10:33:30 This, raise our hand, and only.
10:33:35 You know. Ask the questions. Once I caught your name.
10:33:40 Okay. Ethan.
10:33:43 2. So 2 courses, but one halfway I hear you say 2 courses right?
10:33:54 No, there's 2 pathway.
10:33:54 But okay, okay.
10:33:57 So each each pathway only has one cost.
10:34:02 So 2 popways, 2 different courses. But you complete the first.
10:34:05 No, you complete 2 of them.
10:34:09 What you mentioned about the first one.
10:34:11 No idea about the first one.
10:34:14 No, that no first part in that course, or something that was the call.
10:34:17 Oh, no, because inside the cost there's actually 6 to 8. Mode use.
10:34:24 You only need to complete the first module.
10:34:28 So your question pertaining to?
10:34:26 And how? Okay? In each course we complete one month of the.
10:34:35 Depending on the cost you have to reach the cost, instruction.
10:34:44 Yeah, yeah.
10:34:42 Okay, okay, that's good.
10:34:51 I thought I'd tell you. Hey? Sakes!
10:34:55 Thanks. Why is it only 5?
10:34:48 Okay. Thanks. Ethan. Okay, if you see the ux ui design this, actually 2 certification causes.
10:35:06 Oh!
10:35:07 So if you see, add together, is actually 6 of them.
10:35:11 Hmm, okay, interesting.
10:35:16 Thanks. Travel.
10:35:21 Yeah, so.
10:35:28 Sir, hey? Say for or financial marketing? We only need to put like if we could, the core modules, it would be considered as the one will be in like one instead of well, learning track done right?
10:35:44 That's right.
10:35:43 Okay, hey? And what about the rest? Are they kind of in the same like formats?
10:35:53 No, there are different formats. So there are. Yeah. The Google Coursera, one.
10:36:03 Yeah.
10:36:02 Okay, is Google, digital garage. Okay? Most, those at the exact cost.
10:36:10 You'll be given the instructions. Shit on what to do.
10:36:15 Yeah, so each of them has different competition. Criteria.
10:36:19 You need to reach through them.
10:36:23 Yeah.
10:36:23 And can you say me, too? Why, only 2 courses to get the multi multi bill would be the. Was he set the or 4 again?
10:36:34 Sorry I didn't catch that, because it broke.
10:36:37 Sorry this? You say, yeah, good. During the like.
10:36:44 Oh, shit right, they say. Why, only 2 courses it's because you say, like to get multi-visibility sets.
10:36:56 What were they for? Morgan?
10:36:56 No, I'm saying that. Why are we want you to take 2 causes is because we want you to acquire multi disciplinary skills.
10:37:06 Yeah.
10:37:06 It's a multi disciplinary skills.
10:37:09 Yes, across different domains.
10:37:13 Okay.
10:37:14 Yeah, which is actually helpful for you to get endemployment.
10:37:20 Okay.
10:37:19 Okay.
10:37:23 Thanks.
10:37:25 Okay.
10:37:31 Yup!
10:37:29 Morning, Mr. Wong. So my question I want to clarify something else.
10:37:46 Yeah.
10:37:38 You mentioned earlier that you will be a reimbursing us like the modules, like $120 worth right.
10:37:48 Does that mean that all these modules are paid, or only some of them are paid?
10:37:57 And if so, is it like the 120 cumulative?
10:38:13 Okay, so let me explain. There are some causes that are free to take that you don't need to pay, you know, with cash.
10:38:27 First. So far, as the Bloomberg market concept, the Esg reporting and the digital marketing ones.
10:38:36 Okay, all these, you can just sign up with the promote code.
10:38:42 You don't need to pay first the cost sets by Google or the edx by Wtc.
10:38:54 Right. Those in need to P.
10:38:01 So that means, if we did more than one module, that means, once we use up 120, we cannot take further modules, or is it?
10:39:04 I never call you.
10:38:57 So!
10:39:10 I got your question.
10:39:14 Boy speaking. I never call your name.
10:39:16 No, it's me, Pennington.
10:39:18 Yeah, I never call your name. So you don't speak.
10:39:20 Zoom butt. Uhhuh.
10:39:22 I never call him so. You don't speak. Yeah. So I'm answering the question.
10:39:29 You want us? Okay, okay, so, yeah, so for the coursera and the edx, you actually need to pick right?
10:39:42 But will pay for them up to 100 twenty-.
10:39:49 So it's like cumulative. And so it's not like 120 per more per module.
10:39:52 No, because this subscription, based?
10:39:55 Okay. Okay.
10:39:57 Yeah, a subscription base. Yeah. The coursera is about $52 per month.
10:40:10 So that means I can. 2 months, but I also I a 100 to need an update 2 months, about 100 plus for each module if I'm planning to take 2 paid ones.
10:40:23 Okay. Okay. Thank you.
10:40:08 Yeah, yeah, no, because no, because it's a subscription base.
10:40:30 Once you have the subscription, you can actually assess to unlimited content.
10:40:36 Incorsera.
10:40:43 Yes.
10:40:37 Oh, so $120, since it's a subscription under Coursera, then, can take multiple within the 2 months.
10:40:46 And yeah, we didn't call. So you can see, pick one design thinking like us.
10:40:56 Uhhuh.
10:40:56 Ui design, and one say, data analytics. They fall under the same subscript per month.
10:41:03 So $52. You can already assess this 2 content.
10:41:09 Hmm!
10:41:06 Hey? Then? What if like I wanted the again. You are your X. By then, under the W.
10:41:14 Tree C, and then another. One. Data analytics.
10:41:17 So add together. It's if it exceeds 120, then you have to pay yourself loop.
10:41:28 Yeah.
10:41:26 Also is okay. So because 2 different then is 880.
10:41:31 Yup! Yup!
10:41:32 Okay, okay, yeah, that's it for me. Thank you.
10:41:35 Thank you. Hey? This!
10:41:39 Mr. William, I have some learning questions are okay. But then let me just speak a bit fast about the for more call. We're given this Friday, if but here, on the right.
10:41:49 Yes, before next meeting. Yes.
10:41:51 And then also of only 45. Okay, okay? So basically, like, on Wednesday, you asked us to ask us to say, Oh, which are you interested? Is on Monday?
10:42:00 Yeah.
10:42:03 Yeah. Then also the also same thing. Right? Also provide us.
10:42:08 Yes.
10:42:12 Okay.
10:42:10 Hmm! Then nothing is about the you see, the you know instruments for you are.
10:42:16 Are we a lot to say? Continue even from Monday to Thursday after the physical tomorrow program?
10:42:24 So your question is whether you can do e-learning after physical sessions.
10:42:30 Yes, miss, Like, after you dismiss us from the program from Monday to thirteenth.
10:42:34 Yeah, is, is really up to you to plan when you want to do the learning, you're gonna do it at night, after the program you are free to do so.
10:42:44 But we have dedicated one e-learning day just for you to work on this.
10:42:51 Every week.
10:42:54 Alright! So we have already dedicated, you know, 8 h for you to go through them, but if you need more time, you can.
10:43:04 Yeah, to do. So, okay.
10:43:08 Gerald.
10:43:06 We can. Thanks, thanks.
10:43:20 Yes.
10:43:11 Yeah, Hi, Mr. So let me get this straight. So only the ones on on edx are paid right? Which means digital marketing is free.
10:43:23 Digital marketing is free.
10:43:24 Okay. And the one is, I can take more than 2 costs right?
10:43:29 But your priority is for you to convene the first 2 of us.
10:43:34 Yeah.
10:43:32 Okay. Okay. Thank you.
10:43:39 Okay. I hope that answers your question, Gerard.
10:43:44 Burnington, your turn!
10:43:54 You're muted, Burnington.
10:43:57 The bumper one if we put down the other costs.
10:43:57 I have to pay.
10:44:00 The Bloomberg one is free, the other causes you pay first the rest of once you pay ready, and you complete, that you can submit.
10:44:09 You know the amount that you paid, you know, to claim from tomorrow what we're $120.
10:44:17 Oh, and but and for the bubble code, is it to access the website themselves, or to actually show auto, actually get a distract for the other web sites?
10:44:28 Yeah, the promo code is actually for the Bloomberg cost.
10:44:35 Yeah, for you to get a Bloomberg course, or some of them.
10:44:38 The actually the Google Casera one, the Google Coursera.
10:44:44 One is also pick. There's a promo code.
10:44:47 There's free one. Okay?
10:44:49 So I need to first submit the promote. So I need to.
10:44:59 Yeah, breaking up, Bunnington. I cannot hear you.
10:45:03 So just saying that I should get the sorry I sent it.
10:45:08 I used to promote code to get access to the website. And I correct.
10:45:12 Yes. Correct. So, in the way for us to give it to you.
10:45:16 But we'll let you choose them next.
10:45:24 Hey? Am I making sense? Okay, great travel.
10:45:31 Thanks.
10:45:32 Well, I know you mentioned earlier that even after we finished the 2 Tries, it's optional for us to.
10:45:41 I take. They take the other checks right?
10:45:42 Yes, it's totally optional, because different participants have different learning, speed, learning, pace, and different aspirations. So we really leave it up to you.
10:45:54 But we set a minimum criteria. Yeah.
10:45:56 Okay. But my question is, when it comes for us to choose.
10:46:02 So which which to? For we want which to we want to choose.
10:46:07 The well, if I say we finished like more than the 2 tracks that we read, can we?
10:46:16 Okay.
10:46:14 Let's choose the like between all 5 of them, even if they weren't like in our choosing.
10:46:20 Yes, because at about week, 7 week 8 you'll be us to Stony.
10:46:27 Submit your your certificate of completion, and we will ask if you want to take other e-learning costs.
10:46:34 Oh! So!
10:46:35 There is a little time, but we want you to prioritize your tool. Now.
10:46:40 Okay.
10:46:40 Okay. So as a. So I say, like at a later time, like.
10:46:46 If?
10:46:44 Yes, at a later time and week, 7 or week 8. There!
10:46:50 Well, yeah.
10:46:50 Okay. So if we do like complete like, Hey, either to or we, we do 3, 4, 5, we could choose, like any of them, any 2 of them.
10:47:01 Yes.
10:47:05 Okay.
10:47:03 Okay, hey? I understand. Hey? Thanks.
10:47:12 I'm sorry. Yeah. So the payment when it comes to payment right?
10:47:17 How are we to pay like do we have outright payment?
10:47:20 Can we pay in like the total instead? What? Well, let's see, we kind of become really afford to pay all that one thing for the pain, like.
10:47:27 Okay, okay. So if you have issues with payment, ie.
10:47:34 Maybe you have some. You know cashes time things like that.
10:47:38 You approach Miss Pepper, to discuss on what are some of the options that we can help you with.
10:47:47 I see. Okay. So just come from 120 by 120 for a course. Right?
10:47:45 The payment itself. Thanks. Total. Yes. Yeah.
10:48:00 Okay. Thank you.
10:47:57 It should be more than enough. 120. And yeah, yeah.
10:48:09 Kevin.
10:48:27 So we should the whole.
10:48:32 Julian, can you come nearer to the mic? Because I cannot hear you clearly?
10:48:45 Yeah.
10:48:49 Yup!
10:48:35 I say, like I'll be able to get the full certification.
10:48:50 Automatically done within the subscription period.
10:48:53 Okay. So if you read through the text that we sent you, okay, do.
10:49:02 Okay, I think, forget it. To help you answer like, very directly. The Google certifications require about 4 to 5 months to complete.
10:49:29 Oh!
10:49:18 Yeah, so it is not as straightforward as it seems, for to complete the full certification, and hence we only require you to take the first module, but they actually give out certificates for every modulus complete.
10:49:35 Okay.
10:49:36 Yeah. But if you want to get a full certification, it will take the fastest piece, even if you go.
10:49:45 Is but a typical participants usually take about 6 months, so they will be out of the program.
10:49:51 Oh, okay.
10:49:52 Yeah, but it is really and up to you to decide whether you want to take the full certification.
10:50:00 Alright, which we actually encourage you to do so.
10:50:06 Okay.
10:50:16 Oh, sorry! Oh, so how long does it take to comp each so which cost?
10:50:32 Oh!
10:50:10 In, in, the, info sheet, where you read, there is HD. Or time they will specify a dedicated that you would be required to complete the cost.
10:50:43 Oh!
10:50:36 However, whatever is that? There does not include your personal revision time. You know how long the cost will take.
10:50:45 I wonder what's the price of the you know, whatever for the other ux design costs.
10:50:56 Yup!
10:50:55 The edx one. Is it? The one is in the info sheet? You can actually read it to.
10:51:02 Okay.
10:51:04 So!
10:51:04 Desiree.
10:51:13 Mr. William, just to confirm well, the website links to the courses be posted somewhere.
10:51:20 Okay.
10:51:20 It's on. Ms. Teams are ready. So if you go to Ms teams and files, you actually will get to see the e-learning folder.
10:51:31 So all the resources for e-learning folder where you need to reach through is on. There.
10:51:35 So you actually can take this whole afternoon to reach through it after you have complete that.
10:51:40 Your strengths find a assessment.
10:51:42 Okay, one more question. If we don't have the credit card, how will we pay for the cost?
10:51:57 Okay.
10:51:53 Yeah, you speak to Miss paper. It will help you with that, Eric.
10:52:03 Okay. If there are no further questions, I just like to highlight again on.
10:52:12 Some of the key points for your strings. Find a assessment.
10:52:18 Okay, I'll just go highlight again, for our strengths find the assessment.
10:52:23 You should receive the link for your strengths, find that assessment it should be sent to the email that you gave us.

10:52:46 Okay. You are supposed to complete that by end of today you just answer the question.
10:52:55 As it is, there's no need to overthink.
10:52:59 There is no best answer. You just answer is based on whatever comes to your mind.
10:53:05 The first instance.
10:53:09 Okay, you come to your mind. You answer, based on what come to your mind.
10:53:17 There's no best answer is not a test. There's no great.
10:53:22 It is really about understanding your personality problem.

10:53:46 It's of AI. I have to sign up.
10:53:51 So is this a permanent thing, or is this like something you get this week after, like a year or 2?
10:53:58 That the results of it, of the strengths.
10:54:01 Okay. So it's really up to you, like for us.
10:54:06 We? I do still keep my with me, but for a strainfinder.
10:54:16 Every 5 years!
10:54:11 If it is recommended that you take only after every 5, because your environment, your circumstances will change, and whenever there's a change in environment, your strengths preference will also change.
10:54:27 So, if you take it, it should last you for at least 5 years.
10:54:32 You can actually go back before and meet about it. So it is entirely up to you whether you want to use this as a one- or do you want to use this as a permanent thing.
10:54:45 What we will do for you also. Once you do the assessment, we will print out your meeting, and we will give it to you physically.
10:54:55 Hmm!
10:54:52 So, okay, so because the email that I sent to your is my school one which is not permanent.
10:54:59 Hmm, yeah.
10:55:01 So if I were to use my more permanent.
10:55:04 Is okay. You can change the email after that.
10:55:07 But then we like because you say you want to print out the report right?
10:55:11 That? Will it affect your?
10:55:12 No, that the once you submit, it will go to the system, and then is able to channel the report.

10:59:51 So the possible rest when you can't. But don't worry.
10:59:59 Okay. It is not going to be your own that fast that you can follow.
11:00:08 We have actually view support and safety net on that already. You're not have a good weekend.
11:00:16 I'll see you guys next week. Bye, bye!
11:00:17 Bye-bye.
11:00:19 Bye!
11:00:19 Bye!
11:00:20 Okay.
11:00:23 Hi, happy weekends!
11:00:25 I'm
11:00:24 Bye!
11:00:26 In my mind.
11:00:28 We? There is a name, hey?
11:00:40 No worries. Go ahead!
11:00:35 Sorry, Mr. William, I have another question to confirm. Okay, is there another session?
11:00:47 In the afternoon.
11:00:47 No, there's no other e session.
11:00:49 Okay. Thank you very much.
11:00:51 Yeah, so that's all for today. You can just go through and read through the e-learning costs.
11:01:00 An explore them.
11:01:01 Okay? And I'll do the strengths. Find the test also.
11:01:06 Yes, thank you, Christopher.
11:01:13 Oh, oh, yeah, I did. Actually, when I managed to go on what I mentioned to get into the Zoom One time.
11:01:23 Don't worry about it. We match your attendance.
11:01:26 Okay. Oh, oh, yeah, I think just a quick way.
11:01:37 Yeah.
11:01:31 So as I understand, we'll we'll be going through the just a couple we'll be going to the Ecosas.
11:01:39 So, okay, I think, if okay, so once we can decide which cost to be, you mentioned that the payment.
11:01:52 Autumn will do the painfulness, or just, or we do our payment first, and we will be reimbursed.
11:01:56 Okay, so.
11:01:59 We prefer for you to do the own payment first, and then you will claim but if we have issues with that, you let us know.
11:02:10 Okay. Yeah.
11:02:09 Okay, hey? Okay, so.
11:02:15 Okay? So I suppose I should. I think. I wonder, since we know that each Friday will be allowed to do our eighteenth to tell it. How will you guys know whether we will be taking out e-learning on Friday?
11:02:28 Christopher, I think you are a adult already.
11:02:32 Oh!
11:02:32 There's no need for us to monitor what you do.
11:02:37 And your free time. We just need you to convict your e-larning by week.
11:02:45 Okay. Okay.
11:02:46 10. Yeah, oh, no. We 11. We just need you to complete it by week.
11:02:51 11, on 20 fifth of. So you are supposed to plan your own time and your own pace to complete them.
11:02:58 Oh, okay.
11:03:00 You we won't monitor. You check your attendance, and things like that.
11:03:03 If you decide not to complete by the end of the program, you won't receive your site.
11:03:11 But right? So we leave it really entirely up to you.
11:03:10 Okay, so okay, so about once we select our what costs, you want to go for it.
11:03:22 We could do that on time, that most likely most likely we got to Friday to do it.
11:03:25 Most of the time, but we could use different timing later if we want to catch up right.
11:03:30 Yeah.
11:03:31 Okay, so the payment if anything we did pay we had to pay.
11:03:34 We can pay our. So while we could get to be reimburse.
11:03:37 But we can check help if we haven't trouble right?
11:03:38 Yes.
11:03:44 Hmm! That's all right.
